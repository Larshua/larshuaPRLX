    <h3>Handcrafted</h3>

    <h3>Recycled Items</h3>
    <p>This craft has an eco-friendly component because the materials used can be recycled. Pipe cleaners are a multipurpose object that is seen in many homes. They are frequently constructed from wire and fuzzy material. You may help reduce waste by reusing them. To give the floral design more texture and detail, you may also use additional recycled materials like old buttons, plastic bottles for the flower's pot, and leftover fabric.</p>
